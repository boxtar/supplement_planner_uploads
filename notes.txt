Run the very slow enquiry RSO - RESBUD Costs per Period.

Once you get your results copy them to Excel.

Filter on blanks in "Period" column and delete them. Now we have a sanitised database to work with.

Use filtering (or whatever you are used to) to copy all data for each Sub-project to its own sheet.

Infront of you is all the FEC and PRICE budgets phased across all headings for the sub-project.
You can start copying and pasting data over to the planner template.

NOTE: that you'll have to  manually figure out the PBFEC XZ90 Income amounts per period for each
sub-project (see below, it's easy).

ALSO NOTE: if your project's claim type is Fixed then your PBPRICE budget should all be under XZ90 Income,
not each budget heading. You can use the process below to get this data.


----------------------------


How to get Income (XZ90) phasing for PBFEC:

It's simply just the sum of all PRICE amounts for each Resbud per Period.

Insert > Pivot Table. Period as Row. Price as Values. You now have your period and value list.

Remember to negate the amounts - the Income budget against PBFEC should be negative.

Repeat this for each sub-project sheet.


NOTE: If project claim type is fixed then you can use the pivot table data for the PBPRICE budget
as it should all fall under XZ90 - Income.


----------------------------


JUST INCASE YOU AREN'T AWAKE YET: If the project claim type is fixed then the PBPRICE budget should 
all be under XZ90 Income. This is actually easy
